## Summary
Purrfect Match Cats & Co. is an non-profit animal shelter with multiple locations in the Greater Des Moines area that houses thousands of animals yearly. Their goal is to find the "perfect match" for the animals in their care by helping to get them adopted, or reunited with their owners. Recently they have been looking into how to improve their services by increasing the number of cats that find their forever homes. 
- *Problem:* Purrfect Match has a lot of data on the animals in their shelters, but they don't know how to use it. 
- *Goal:* Determine what factors lead to cats going home with someone.

### Documents & References
#### Documents

1. Purpose of Files in GitHub Repository - A standard practice for ReadMe files is to explain the purpose of each individual file in our repository. 
   - An example of this would be the file for our main code. 
   - A description of this could be something along the lines of "This R file serves as a container for *all* approved additions to our code, and additionally helps to maintain continuity between the individual assignments of team members."

*Data Source:* The data used is titled "Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes" and can be found on Kaggle. The original intention of this dataset was to provide outcomes for cats in the Austin Animal Center Shelter, but was repurposed for the use of this project.
