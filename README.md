# ReadMe: Deliverable for Purrfect Match Cats & Co. 

*Data Source:* The data used is titled "Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes" and can be found on Kaggle. The original intention of this dataset was to provide outcomes for cats in the Austin Animal Center Shelter, but was repurposed for the use of this project. 


Information that we need to incorporate into our ReadMe file (as a start) is as follows:
1. Summary - provide a summary of what we are trying to accomplish, in more common vernacular (basically a writing prompt of who the company we work for is, and what the *need* for this project is. 
2. Project Goal - what is our end deliverable, who are we doing this for? (Purrfect Match Cats & Co.)
3. Methods - what are we doing to accomplish our goals? (in brief)
5. Purpose of Files in GitHub Repository
   - A standard practice for ReadMe files is to explain the purpose of each individual file in our repository. An example of this would be the file for our main code.
     - A description of this could be something along the lines of "This R file serves as a container for *all* approved additions to our code, and additionally helps to maintain continuity between the individual assignments of team members."
