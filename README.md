# ReadMe: Purrfect Match Cats & Co. 
### Understanding the Factors that Lead Adoption

Information that we need to incorporate into our ReadMe file (as a start) is as follows:
1. Summary - provide a summary of what we are trying to accomplish, in more common vernacular (basically a writing prompt of who the company we work for is, and what the *need* for this project is. 
2. Project Goal - what is our end deliverable, who are we doing this for? (Purrfect Match Cats & Co.)
3. Methods - what are we doing to accomplish our goals? (in brief)
4. Data Source - what data are we using, and where is it from?
5. Purpose of Files in GitHub Repository
   - A standard practice for ReadMe files is to explain the purpose of each individual file in our repository. An example of this would be the file for our main code.
     - A description of this could be something along the lines of "This R file serves as a container for *all* approved additions to our code, and additionally helps to maintain continuity between the individual assignments of team members."
